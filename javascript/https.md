# VERY IMPORTANT NOTES

1. Here, we are going to discuss what is `HTTP`,
2. How does it work?


## What is `HTTP` and `TCP`?
It stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol which basically is a set of rules which manages the requests and responses between the server and the client over the internet. Now, `TCP`is another protocol which stands for Transfer Control Protocol. It is resposible for managing the contents over the channel established between the server and the client.

TCP is used to manage many types of internet connections in which one computer or device wants to send something to another. HTTP is the command language that the devices on both sides of the connection must follow in order to communicate.
